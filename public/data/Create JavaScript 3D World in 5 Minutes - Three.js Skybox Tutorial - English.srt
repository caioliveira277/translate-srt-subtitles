hello and welcome to red stapler Channel
in this tutorial I'm going to show you

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,140
how to create an easy 3d world with
skybox technique and three.js in just

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,750
a few minutes ready let's check it out

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,420
the concept of skybox is really simple
create a cube to contain your 3d world

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,860
and then assign the right texture to
each side of the cube there are lots of

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,510
available skybox images online both
free and paid version for this tutorial

7
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,940
I'm going to download one from opengameart.org and then move all images to

8
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,440
the web directory next let's start with
the basic setup for three.js as usual

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,479
first include the latest version of the
library then I'm going to create a scene

10
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,060
set up a camera and renderer

11
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,070
I will used current viewport as renderer size and added to the page as canvas element

12
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,040
next I will set up an orbitControl.js to enable mouse control of the camera

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,360
and here is the key part I'm going to
create an array to store materials for

14
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,410
each side of the cube then use texture
loader to load the image

15
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,930
and once loaded we'll push each material
to the array we'll use meshBasicMaterial

16
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,850
for the skybox this material is
not affected by light so we don't have

17
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:47,320
to set up any light and still be able to
see it then we will create a box

18
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:57,090
geometry and put it together with the
material array to create a queue and

19
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,600
added to the scene

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:11,240
finally we will create a recursive
function loop to render a scene

21
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,459
now if you check the result you won't be
able to see anything but if you zoom out

22
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:28,250
you know why it because we assign the
texture to the outside of the cube we can

23
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:36,889
fix this by setting the side property of
the material to three.backside

24
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,320
looks good but there's still a problem
if we zoom out too much it will break

25
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:57,569
the skybox so we will have to limit the
zoom distance like so

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,379
and that's it hope you guys enjoyed this
